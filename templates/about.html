                        MakeMyRecipe was born from a simple idea: to help people create delicious Indian meals with whatever ingredients they have at home. We understand that sometimes you're missing that one ingredient from a recipe, or maybe you have a refrigerator full of items but no idea what to cook. That's where we come in!
                    </p>

                        Our application suggests personalized Indian recipes based on the ingredients you already have, eliminating food waste and inspiring culinary creativity in your kitchen.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-text">
